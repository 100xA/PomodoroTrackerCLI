# Simple Pomodoro Tracker 

Are you tired of Pomodoro Applications that are to overstacked? This is a simple PomodoroTracker built into your Terminal for your Mac machine.

Essentially it has two modes:

- **pomoShort:** a 25(work)/5(rest) min split 
- **pomoLong:** a 50(work)/10(rest) min split

Both splits can be repeated as much as they can.

## Installation

### Zsh

This project requires the Z-Shell to work. Get more info [here](https://ohmyz.sh).

### Timer

This project requires the [timer](https://github.com/caarlos0/timer) project to work properly.

### Setup

1. Create / navigate towards your .zshrc file - ```nano ~\.zshrc```
2. Paste the script underneath your PATH variables

That's it! Now you have a quick Pomodoro-CLI for your productivity setup :D


# Developer Notes

I am probably going to update this project in the future, depending on what suits best for this minimal application!
